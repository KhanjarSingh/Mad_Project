## **3. Problem Statement**
Standing in long queues at government offices, banks, clinics, or restaurants wastes time and causes frustration. Many people spend hours waiting physically when they could be doing something else.  
This project aims to create a system where users can join and track queues virtually, reducing idle waiting time and improving service efficiency.

---

## **4. Proposed Solution / Idea**
A mobile application that allows users to join a virtual queue remotely and get real-time updates on their position.  
The app will use GPS tracking and smart notifications to alert users when they are close to the front, so they can arrive just in time.  
Businesses can integrate their queues into the system, enabling them to manage customers efficiently and reduce crowding.

## **5. Key Features**
- Join queues remotely from anywhere.
- Real-time queue position and estimated wait time.
- GPS-based arrival time predictions.
- Notifications when it’s your turn or when to leave.
- Business dashboard to manage queues.
- Option for VIP/express queue upgrades.

## **6. Target Users / Audience**
- Government offices (passport, Aadhaar, license centers)
- Banks & ATMs
- Hospitals & clinics
- Restaurants with long wait times
- Service centers (electronics, automotive)
- Amusement parks & events
